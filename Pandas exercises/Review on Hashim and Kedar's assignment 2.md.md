# Goal: Review on Pandas exercise 2

Everything was done in the exercise. Using the head() only showed first few rows, however, for more rows such as head(20) could have been used. Also, in the case of the quantity of most expensive item ordered - they used " new_chipo.item_price.max()" which gave the output 44.25. It's actually the max price only, not the qualtity.
